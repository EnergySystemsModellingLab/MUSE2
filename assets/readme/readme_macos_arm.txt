This folder contains the MUSE 2.0 executable for macOS (Apple Silicon), called `muse2`.

When trying to run the `muse2` program, you may see an error message saying "muse2 can't be opened
because Apple cannot check it for malicious software." To fix this, you should open `muse2` by
right-clicking on it in your file explorer and clicking "Open". You will be prompted to give
permission for the program to run. Once you have completed this step, you should be able to run the
program as normal.

For more information on how to use MUSE 2.0, you can consult the program help:

    ./muse2 help
