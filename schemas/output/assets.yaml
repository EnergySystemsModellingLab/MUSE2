description: Assets commissioned during the course of the simulation.

fields:
  - name: asset_id
    type: string
    description: The ID number of this asset
    notes: |
      Every commissioned asset in the system is automatically assigned a numerical ID. This includes
      assets supplied by the user in the `assets.csv` input file as well as those selected by agents
      during the simulation.
  - name: process_id
    type: string
    description: The ID of this asset's associated process
  - name: region_id
    type: string
    description: The region in which this asset exists
  - name: agent_id
    type: string
    description: The agent to which this asset belongs
  - name: group_id
    type: string
    description: The group ID number of this asset, if any
    notes: |
      Assets that have been created by dividing a parent asset are identified together by their group
      id. If an asset does not come from a divided asset, then this field will be empty.
  - name: commission_year
    type: integer
    description: The year in which the asset was commissioned
  - name: decommission_year
    type: integer
    description: The year in which the asset was decommissioned
    notes: |
      This field will be empty if the asset was not decommissioned during the lifetime of the
      simulation
  - name: capacity
    type: number
    description: The capacity of the asset
