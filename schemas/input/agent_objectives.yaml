  Describes the agents' objectives.

notes:
  - Every agent must have one objective for each milestone year.
  - If the weighted sum decision rule is in use, the `decision_weight` value must be provided,
    otherwise it must be omitted.
  - If the lexico decision rule is in use, the `decision_lexico_order` value must be provided,
    otherwise it must be omitted.

fields:
  - name: agent_id
    type: string
    description: An agent ID
  - name: years
    type: string
    description: The year(s) to which this entry applies
    notes: One or more milestone years separated by semicolons or `all`
  - name: objective_type
    type: string
    enum: [lcox, npv]
    description: The type of objective
    notes: |
      Must be `npv` (net present value) or `lcox` (levelised cost of X). Note that support for NPV
      is [currently broken](https://github.com/EnergySystemsModellingLab/MUSE2/issues/716), so don't
      enable this option unless you know what you're doing.
