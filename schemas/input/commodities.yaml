description: |
  Describes commodities in the system.

notes:
  - Every SED (supply equals demand) commodity must have both producer and consumer processes for
    every region and milestone year.
  - Every SVD (service demand) commodity must have a producer for every region and milestone year.

fields:
  - name: id
    type: string
    description: A unique identifier for the commodity
  - name: description
    type: string
    description: A human-readable label for the commodity
  - name: type
    type: string
    enum: [svd, sed, oth]
    description: The type of commodity
    notes: |
      Must be one of `svd` (service demand), `sed` (supply equals demand) or `oth` (other)
  - name: time_slice_level
    type: string
    enum: [annual, season, daynight]
    description: The time slice level at which constraints for this commodity are applied
    notes: |
      Must be one of `annual` (whole year), `season` (whole season) or `daynight` (a particular time
      of day)
  - name: pricing_strategy
    type: string
    enum: [shadow, marginal, full, scarcity, unpriced]
    description: The pricing strategy for this commodity
    notes: |
      Optional. If specified, must be one of `shadow` (priced using shadow prices from supply-demand
      constraints), `marginal` (priced at the marginal cost of production) , `full` (priced at the
      full cost of production including capital costs), `scarcity` (priced adjusted for scarcity),
      or `unpriced` (not priced at all).

      For `svd` and `sed` commodities, this must be one of `shadow`, `marginal` or `full`. For `oth`
      commodities, this must be `unpriced`.

      If unspecified, the commodity will use the default pricing strategy according to the commodity
      type: `shadow` for `svd` and `sed` commodities, and `unpriced` for `oth` commodities.
  - name: units
    type: string
    description: The units of measurement for this commodity
    notes: |
      This field is used for validation only and is not used for internal unit conversions. MUSE
      will validate that all SED/SVD output flows from the same process have the same units,
      as the annual fixed costs are distributed proportionally between outputs based on flow coefficients.
      E.g. "PJ" (Petajoules), "t" (Tonnes).
