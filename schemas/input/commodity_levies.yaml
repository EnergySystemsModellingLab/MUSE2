  Defines levies for commodities (or, if `value` is negative, incentives).

notes:
  - If an entry is included for a given combination of commodity and region, entries must be
    provided covering all milestone years and time slices. For those regions not explicitly included
    for a given commodity, a zero levy/incentive is assumed. At least one levy/incentive entry must
    be provided for at least one commodity. For one particular combination of region, year and
    time slice, there can be one production and one consumption levy, or a single net levy.
