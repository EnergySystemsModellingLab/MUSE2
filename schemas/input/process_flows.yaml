  The commodity flows for each process

notes:
  - Commodity flows can vary by region and year.
  - For each process, there must be entries covering all the years and regions in which the process
    operates.
  - One (and only one) commodity flow for each region/year must be designated as the primary
    activity commodity (PAC).
