description: Parameters which affect the behaviour of the model. Most are optional.
type: object
properties:
  milestone_years:
    type: array
    items:
      type: integer
    description: The milestone years for the simulation
    notes: Must be positive integers that are sorted and unique
  candidate_asset_capacity:
    type: number
    description: Capacity to give to candidate assets in dispatch optimisation
    default: 0.0001
    notes: |
      The default value should work. Do not change this value unless you know what you're doing!
  capacity_limit_factor:
    type: number
    description: A factor which constrains the maximum capacity given to candidate assets
    default: 0.1
    notes: |
      This is the proportion of the maximum required capacity across time slices (for a given
      asset/commodity etc. combination).
  value_of_lost_load:
    type: number
    description: The cost applied to unmet demand
    default: 1e9
    notes: |
      Currently this only applies to the LCOX appraisal.
  max_ironing_out_iterations:
    type: integer
    description: The maximum number of iterations to run the "ironing out" step of agent investment for
    default: 10
  price_tolerance:
    type: number
    description: The relative tolerance for price convergence in the ironing out loop
    default: 1e-6
  capacity_margin:
    type: number
    description: Slack proportion for assets selected during cycle balancing to absorb small demand shifts
    default: 0.2
  please_give_me_broken_results:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Allows other options that are known to be broken to be used. Please don't ever enable this.
