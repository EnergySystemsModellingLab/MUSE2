description: |
  Defines constraints on process availabilities throughout the year.

notes:
  - Limits can be combined across multiple time periods. For example, users could provide a limit
    of "..0.9" for "winter.day" and "..0.5" for "winter", indicating that the activity can reach
    up to 90% during winter days, so long as activity does not exceed 50% across winter as a whole.
  - Incompatible limits will be flagged at the input validation stage. For example, a limit of
    "..0.01" for "winter" would likely be incompatible with a limit of "0.9.." for "winter.day".
  - If a limit is provided for any time slice (or season) for a particular process/region/year, it
    must be provided for all time slices (or seasons).

fields:
  - name: process_id
    type: string
    description: The process to which this entry applies
  - name: regions
    type: string
    description: The region(s) to which this entry applies
    notes: One or more region IDs, separated by semicolons or the string `all`
  - name: years
    type: string
    description: The milestone year(s) to which this entry applies
    notes: One or more milestone years separated by semicolons, `all` to select all years or a year
      range in the form 'start..end' to select all valid years within range, inclusive. Either 'start'
      'end' or both can be omitted, which will set the corresponding limit to the minimum or maximum
      valid year, respectively.
  - name: time_slice
    type: string
    description: The time slices(s) to which this entry applies
    notes: |
      Can be a single time slice (e.g. `winter.day`), a season (e.g. `winter`) or `annual`. If a
      season or `annual`, this means that limit will apply to the season/year as a whole.
  - name: limits
    type: string
    description: Lower and upper limits on the availability of the process within the specified time slice(s)
    notes:
      A string in the format `min..max`, where `min` and `max` are decimal numbers between 0 and 1
      inclusive (e.g. "0.2..0.9"). 0 represents no availability, and 1 represents full availability.
      Either `min` or `max` can be omitted (e.g "0.2.." or "..0.9"), which will set the
      corresponding limit to 0 or 1, respectively.
