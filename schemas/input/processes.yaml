  Describes processes in the system.

fields:
  - name: id
    type: string
    description: A unique identifier for a process
  - name: description
    type: string
    description: A human-readable label for the process
  - name: regions
    type: string
    description: The region(s) in which this process can operate
    notes: One or more region IDs, separated by semicolons or the string `all`
  - name: primary_output
    type: string
    description: The primary output commodity, if any, for this process
    notes: |
      This field *must* be omitted for processes with only input flows. It *can* be omitted if
      there is only one output flow, in which case it will be inferred.
  - name: start_year
    type: integer
    description: The first year when this process is available to agents
  - name: end_year
    type: integer
    description: The last year when this process is available to agents
    notes: Must be >= to `start_year`
  - name: capacity_to_activity
    type: number
    description: Factor relating capacity units (e.g. GW) to activity units (e.g. PJ). It is the
      maximum activity per year for one unit of capacity.
    notes: Must be >=0. Optional (defaults to 1.0).
  - name: unit_size
    type: number
    description: Capacity of the units in which an asset for this process will be divided into when
      commissioned, if any.
    notes: If present, must be >0. Optional (defaults to None). Assets with a defined unit size are
      divided into n = ceil(C / U) equal units, where C is overall capacity and U is unit_size
      (i.e. rounding up the number of units, which may result in a total capacity greater than C, if
      C is not an exact multiple of U).

      It should be noted that making this number too small with respect to the typical size of an
      asset might create hundreds or thousands of children assets, with a very negative effect on
      the performance. Users are advised to use this feature with care.
