This model is like the "simple" example, except that it includes a separate biomass supply chain,
which has no capacity in the base year. This is partly done to exemplify how MUSE2 can generate
prices for commodities not utilised in a given year.

This is identical to the "missing_commodity" example, but written as a patch with "_diff" files and
a `base_model` specified in `model.toml`.
