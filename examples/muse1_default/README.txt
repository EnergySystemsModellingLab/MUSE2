This model is a port of the default model for MUSE v1 (see [1]), primarily for comparison (e.g.
benchmarking). Note that the model is not an exact port as MUSE v1 and MUSE v2 support different
features. Also be aware that due to this and differences in the underlying algorithm, investment
behaviour will differ between the two programs.

It is broadly similar to the "simple" example, in that it contains a single service demand
commodity, residential heat, which can be served by either gas boilers or heat pumps, though some of
the details, such as parameter values, are different. It also includes a carbon tax.
