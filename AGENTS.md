## Code style and architecture

- When generating or reviewing code, please consult the guidelines in
  `docs/developer_guide/architecture.md`
- If adding a new feature or fixing a bug that was present in the last release of MUSE2, add a note
  to `docs/release_notes/upcoming.md`
- Prefer UK spelling in code and documentation

For Rust code:

- Prefer `use` imports to fully qualified paths
