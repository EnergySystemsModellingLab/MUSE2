# MUSE 2.0

MUSE 2.0 is a tool for running simulations of energy systems, written in Rust. It is a slimmer and
faster version of [the older MUSE tool].

## Getting started

We recommend that developers use `rustup` to install the Rust toolchain. Follow the instructions on
[the `rustup` website](https://rustup.rs/).

Once you have done so, select the `stable` toolchain (used by this project) as your default with:

```sh
rustup default stable
```

To build the project, run:

```sh
cargo build
```

To run MUSE, you can run:

```sh
cargo run
```

Tests can be run with:

```sh
cargo test
```

More information is available in [the official `cargo` book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).
