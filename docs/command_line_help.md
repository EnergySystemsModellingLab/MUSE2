# Command-Line Help for `muse2`

This document contains the help content for the `muse2` command-line program. Its contents are
generated automatically by the CI system before the docs are deployed. If, for some reason, you need
to generate it manually, you can run:

```sh
cargo run -- --markdown-help > docs/command_line_help.md
```
