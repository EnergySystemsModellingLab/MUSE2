# Input Format

This document describes the file format for the various input files that MUSE 2.0 requires. Its
contents are generated automatically by the CI system before the docs are deployed. If, for some
reason, you need to generate it manually, you can run:

```sh
python docs/generate_input_format_doc.py > docs/input_format.md
```
