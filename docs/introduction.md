# Introduction

MUSE 2.0 is a tool for running simulations of energy systems, written in Rust. It is a slimmer and
faster version of [the older MUSE tool]. To get started, please look at the [user guide]
and the [command line help].

For an overview of the model, see the [model description] and the [dispatch optimisation
formulation]. For a list of relevant terms, see the [glossary].

If you are a developer, please see the [developer guide].
