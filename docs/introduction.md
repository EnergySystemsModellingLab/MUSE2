# Introduction

MUSE 2.0 is a tool for running simulations of energy systems, written in Rust. It is a slimmer and
faster version of [the older MUSE tool].

To get started, please look at the [user guide]. For a list of relevant terms, see the [glossary].
For details of the algorithm used, see the [dispatch optimisation formulation].

If you are a developer, please see the [developer guide].
