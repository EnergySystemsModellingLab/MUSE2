# Release notes for MUSE2 v2.0.0 (October 14, 2025)

After nearly 18 months of development and 464 PRs, we are pleased to announce the first release of
the all-new MUSE2 🎉! A big thank you to [everyone who contributed to this amazing
milestone](https://github.com/EnergySystemsModellingLab/MUSE2?tab=readme-ov-file#contributors-).

MUSE2 is a tool written in Rust for running simulations of energy systems, which is planned to be
the eventual successor to the original [MUSE](https://github.com/EnergySystemsModellingLab/MUSE_OS).
Note that this is a completely new project written from scratch, with both the code and the model
underlying it redesigned from the ground up to be simpler and faster. By design, we do not wish to
add every feature that MUSE1 has, but we hope to eventually support all the common use cases for
those who run these types of models.

As there are some important features still missing from MUSE2 (e.g. [#794], [#509]), we do not
recommend that you attempt to use it for research at this stage. However, please do give it a spin!
If there are any features missing that you feel are important, let us know by [opening an
issue](https://github.com/EnergySystemsModellingLab/MUSE2/issues).

It is rather unusual to have the first release of a piece of software be 2.0.0. The reason for this
is to avoid confusion with the previous MUSE program. Be aware that this project does not follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

To get started, you can download MUSE2 for your platform below. For more information, please consult
