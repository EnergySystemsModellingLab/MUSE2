# Release notes for MUSE2 v2.1.0 (???????)

## New features

- You can now set both upper and lower bounds for process availabilities ([#363])
- Default output root path is now configurable in `settings.toml` ([#370])
- If demand cannot be satisfied by the simulation, we now inform users what the offending
  commodities and time slices are ([#636])
- Trim whitespace from fields when reading in CSV files ([#648])
- Assets can now be commissioned after a specified number of years with the `mothball_years`
  parameter ([#649])
- Default to no availability limits if user doesn't provide any for a process ([#743])
- Allow user to specify ranges of years in input files ([#845])
- Users can now omit empty CSV files ([#909])
- Users can now optionally specify an explicit decommission year for an asset in `assets.csv` input
  file ([#916])
- Allow for adding both a `prod` and `cons` levy to a commodity ([#945])
- Availability limits can now be provided at multiple levels for a procesws ([#958])
- Pricing strategy can now vary by commodity ([#1013], [#1019])

## Experimental features

- Assets can be now made divisible to represent many individual assets, such as a fleet of gas
  boilers (albeit the current implementation is slow; [#936]). These fleets can be partially
  decommissioned ([#911]).
- Users can now have circular dependencies between commodities, such as a hydrogen power plant that
  itself requires electricity (though the current solution likely won't work in every situation;
  [#794])
- There are new options for pricing strategy (`full` and `marginal`), which take capital costs into
  account ([#1009])

## Bug fixes

- Fix: process availability constraints were wrongly being applied to individual time slices,
  regardless of time slice level ([#957])
- Various fixes to process flows and availabilities input code for non-milestone years ([#770],
  [#859], [#866], [#931])
- Users can now set demand to zero in `demand.csv` ([#850])
- Fix: sign for levies of type `net` was wrong for inputs ([#944])
- Fix `--overwrite` option for `save-graphs` command ([#982])
